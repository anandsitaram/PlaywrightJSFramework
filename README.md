Test Data
The test data is stored in JSON files located in the /src/data directory. You can create or modify test data files as needed. For example, testData.json can include product details, quantities, and shipping information.

Example Test Data Structure

Copy code
{
    "product": "Rocco Gym Tank",
    "qty": "4",
    "color": "Blue",
    "size": "XS",
    "streetAddress": "6789 N Willi",

    "region": "Oregon",
    "postCode": "986451",
    "mobileNo": "1231231231",
    "shippingMethod": "flatrate"
}
Running Tests
To run the test suite, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx playwright test
You can also run specific test files or use tags to filter tests. Refer to the Playwright documentation for more options.

Adding New Tests
Create a new test file in the /src/tests directory.
Import the necessary page objects and utilities.
Use the existing test cases as a reference for structure and format.
Error Handling
The framework includes error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions that may occur during test execution. You can enhance this by adding custom error messages and logging.
